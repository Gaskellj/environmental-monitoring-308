# environmental-monitoring-308

Arduino code and data manipulation/visualization for ESC-308 Environmental Monitoring at Union College. This project aims to assess water quality of a stream ("the groot") which runs through college grounds using an in-situ device containing an Arduino ESP32 and several sensors.

Sensors included within this project are:

1. Temperature sensor
2. pH sensor
3. Turbidity sensor
4. Total dissolved solids (TDS) sensor

## Data analysis and visualization
